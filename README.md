On a trip to NYC we used Citi Bikes to get around the city. This method of transportation allowed us to get to know the city and interact with the people who live there and who are using bikes for their commutes. <br>

After the tip and idea starts to form - start a similar bike share business in our hometown of Des Moines Iowa. We gain the attention of a potential angel investor who may be interested in providing seed funding to explore bringing a bike-share program right here to Des Moines.

Using publically available Citi Bike data we want to analyze how the bike-share business actually works in New York City. From there we'll create a proposal on how it might work in Des Moines.
